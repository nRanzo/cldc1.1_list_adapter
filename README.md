This project includes a class named "ListAdapter," which implements a list compatible with the CLDC 1.1 environment. A complete test suite has been developed to verify the correct functionality of all basic list operations.

The test suite and the test cases are contained in the files "TestRunner" and "ListAdapterTest." Detailed documentation for these files, along with all those contained in the myAdapter package of my homework, is available in Javadoc format. Additionally, an introduction to the test suite is provided in the file "documentazione.pdf," which I recommend reviewing.

Besides the presentation of the test suite, the file "documentazione.pdf" also contains the documentation for the "build.sh" and "testrun.sh" / ".bat" files.

The documentation for the implementations "ListAdapter," "ListAdapterIterator," "ListAdapterListIterator," and "SubList," all contained in the file "ListAdapter.java," is also provided in Javadoc format.

All documentation, both in Javadoc and PDF formats, is accessible from the "docs" folder.

Please note that build.sh was used during the design on a Unix-based system and is not intended for the client.
